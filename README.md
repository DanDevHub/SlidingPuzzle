# Navigation Miracle

## Description
This is a VR-Game. The goal of the project was to build a VR game and to use that game as a basis to find out what difficulties come with navigation and interaction in a VR environment (e.g. Motion sickness when moving, how to show player correct path without traditional methods like HUD), and how those problems can be solved for a VR-Space.

The game we built was an escape-room like puzzle game, in which the player is tasked with completing certain objectives and navigating through the map using hints and pointers.

The platform for which this game was made was the oculus rift devices

## Installation
